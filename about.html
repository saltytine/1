      <ol class="green">
        <p>I am Saltine or Zoe. I have been interested in cybersecurity for years now and I've worked on bug bounties and whatnot. I formally studied psychology, but I've always loved cybersec more. I also play guitar/bass in a small not at all known band.</p>

        <span class="yellow">>> Music</span><br>
        <ol class="green">
          <p>I also make and listen to music, it's one of my favorite things to do. You can listen to my silly stuff on Soundcloud or Bandlab. I don't have anything on Spotify or Apple Music yet. Me and two of my friends essentially try to write songs pretty quickly from AI generated lyrics. I play guitar and bass, Bean sings, and Subi plays drums.</p>

          <p>I had a few easy challenges but those were taken down, so if you're looking for anything there, I'm sorry to disappoint.</p>

        <span class="yellow">>> Cybersecurity</span><br>
        <ol class="green">
          <p>I have been interested in cybersecurity for as long as I remember, because being able to get around problems has always been something I liked. I have done a few bug bounties, for Google and so on. I don't plan on having a job in cybersecurity, but I will always spend more time on it then I will on my job.</p>

          <p>One of the best things I've done with cybersecurity is joined, helped with and now moderated 3C. The people are nice and knowledgeable and I have enjoyed every minute spent in it.</p>
